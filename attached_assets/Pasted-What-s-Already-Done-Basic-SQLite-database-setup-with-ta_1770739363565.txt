What's Already Done:
Basic SQLite database setup with tables

Some authentication code exists

A few UI pages are started

But there's a bug causing problems

What's Broken Right Now:
There's an error on the Customers page saying "money is not defined" on line 280. Please fix this first so the admin can see customer credit limits properly.

What I Need You to Add:
1. Make It Look Professional and Attractive
Use a clean blue color scheme (#2C3E50 for dark blue, #3498DB for light blue)

Make buttons look nice with gradients and hover effects

Add subtle shadows to cards and tables

Make sure it works well on phones and tablets

Add loading animations when data is loading

Show nice success/error messages when users do actions

2. Add Stock Management for Salesmen
Salesmen need to record when they receive books from publishers like Oxford, Paramount, or Gaba.

Please add:

A new page where salesmen can add stock they received

They should select which publisher it came from

Add which books and how many copies

Automatically update the book inventory numbers

Let salesmen view their stock history

Let them print receipts for stock received

3. Add CSV Import/Export (Super Important!)
Make it easy to work with data in Excel/Google Sheets:

For Books:

Add an "Import Books" button on the books page

Let me upload a CSV file with book details

Download a sample template so I know the format

Export all books to CSV with one click

For Customers:

Same import/export for customer lists

For stock records too

4. Add Reporting System That Everyone Can Use
Every user type should be able to generate their own reports:

For Admin:

Sales reports with charts

What books are selling best

How salesmen are performing

Which customers owe money

For Salesmen:

Their personal sales reports

Commission calculations

Stock they've received vs sold

For Customers:

Their order history

Payment records

Invoices

All reports should:

Let users pick date ranges

Export as PDF, Excel, or CSV

Look professional with company branding

5. Complete the Missing Parts
Finish these modules that are incomplete:

Order creation wizard (with real-time price calculation)

Payment tracking system

Salary calculation for salesmen

Invoice generation in PDF format

Dashboard statistics for all user types

6. Fix All Existing Issues
Make sure all pages load without errors

Fix any broken navigation

Test that all user roles work properly

Add proper error messages everywhere

How to Organize the Code:
Please create these folders and files:

text
/utils/           - For CSV processing, PDF generation, etc.
/routes/          - New routes for stock, reports, CSV
/controllers/     - Business logic for new features
/views/           - New EJS pages for stock, reports
What I Want Most Right Now:
First - Fix that money formatting error on line 280

Second - Make the UI look really nice and professional

Third - Add the CSV import/export features

Fourth - Add the stock management for salesmen

Fifth - Add the reporting system

Salesmen can add stock received from publishers

Can import 100 books from a CSV file
