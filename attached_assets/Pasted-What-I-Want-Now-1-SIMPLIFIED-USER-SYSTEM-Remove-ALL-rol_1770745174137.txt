What I Want Now:
1. SIMPLIFIED USER SYSTEM
Remove ALL role selection during signup. Everyone who signs up is just a Customer.

Only THREE user types exist in the system:

Admin - Created manually in database (not through signup)

Salesman - Created by Admin only (not through signup)

Customer - EVERYONE who signs up on the website

What this means:

When someone signs up, they're automatically a Customer

No more choosing between Fixed/Local/Corporate/School

No role selection during registration

Admin and Salesman accounts are created separately by system admin

2. SIMPLE SIGNUP PROCESS
Registration should be super simple:

Signup Form Fields:

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

Password (with strength meter)

Confirm Password

Address (optional during signup, can add later)

That's it! No role selection, no account type choosing, no school details - just basic information.

3. AFTER SIGNUP - Customer Can Choose Their Profile Type
After a customer logs in for the first time, they can OPTIONALLY tell us more about themselves:

On their profile page, they can select:

"I'm an Individual Buyer" (default)

"I'm buying for a School/Institution"

"I'm buying for a Company/Organization"

If they choose School/Company:
They can add additional details:

School/Company Name

Contact Person (if different)

Tax Number (optional)

Special requirements

BUT THIS IS OPTIONAL! They can just stay as Individual Buyer.

4. School Lists Feature Still Needed
Even with simplified signup, customers should still be able to create book lists for different purposes:

Example:
I'm a customer who buys books for:

My own children's school (CCES)

My friend's school (JPS)

My cousin's academy (Lucent Kids)

I should be able to:

Create lists for each school

Add books to each list

Save lists for future orders

Share lists with my salesman
